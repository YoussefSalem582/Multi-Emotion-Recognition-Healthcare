# Multi-Emotion Recognition Healthcare Project

This project aims to revolutionize mental health diagnostics using a multimodal machine-learning framework. By integrating diverse data sources—such as audio, video, and physiological signals—and leveraging datasets like DAIC-WOZ and LMVD, our system identifies early indicators of depression and other mental health conditions with enhanced accuracy.

## Key Features:
- **Multimodal Data Analysis:** Combines behavioral cues from speech, facial expressions, and physiological signals for comprehensive assessments.
- **Advanced Machine Learning Models:** Implements cutting-edge algorithms for feature extraction and data fusion.
- **Early Detection & Personalized Treatment:** Supports healthcare professionals with objective tools to identify subtle symptoms and design tailored treatment strategies.
- **Ethical & Secure:** Ensures data privacy and adheres to ethical guidelines for medical environments.

## Objectives:
- Improve diagnostic accuracy by reducing subjectivity.
- Enable early-stage detection of depression.
- Lay the foundation for scalable mental health diagnostic tools.

This system bridges gaps in traditional mental health assessment methods, paving the way for modern, reliable, and effective solutions in healthcare.
